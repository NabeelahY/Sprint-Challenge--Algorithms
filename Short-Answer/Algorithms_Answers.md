#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(log n)


b) O(n^2)


c) O(bunnies) => O(n)

## Exercise II

# let n be the number of floors in a building
# loop through n as person is climbing to each floor
    # throw egg to determine if egg breaks on that floor
    # if egg does not break, proceed to next floor
    # if egg breaks, return no of floor

Time complexity = 0(n)
